# Real-Estates-Machine-Learning-Project
The Real Estates Machine Learning Project involves training data using various models (linear regression, random forest regressor, and decision tree regressor) to analyze and predict real estate data with best possible accuracy. The project includes data cleaning and manipulation to prepare the data for analysis.

# Model Outputs

1. Decision Tree:

Mean: 4.189504502474483 Standard deviation: 0.848096620323756

2. Linear Regression:

Mean: 4.221894675406022

Standard deviation: 0.7520304927151625

3. Random Forest Regression

Mean: 3.494650261111624

Standard deviation: 0.762041223886678

<br><i>Since Random Forest Regressor is found to be most accurate and precise, we trained our data with this model for future predictions of price!
